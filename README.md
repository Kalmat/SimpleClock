# Simple Clock for Minecraft 1.16.3 #

This is a very simple clock which just shows the in-game time in a human-friendly way, as well as the remaining time to Night or Day (usual leeping or Wake up times).

NOTE: There is a hidden "gift" which can only be found when looting chests in highly dangerous places... Good Luck! (for this, you will have to install this mod on server as well).
